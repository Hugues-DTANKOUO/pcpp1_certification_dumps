# PCPP1™ – Certified Professional in Python Programming 1 (Exam PCPP-32-10x) Dumps

## Overview

This README describes my experience with the PCPP1 exam, which I passed. This exam is intended to assess one's
knowledge and skills in Python programming. I'd like to offer some analysis of the exam, covering my preparation, the
structure of the test, and my general experience.

## Background

I invested the decision to work toward the PCPP1 certification in order to improve my Python programming abilities and
get recognition for my knowledge. Being certified in Python, a flexible and popular programming language, can lead to a
number of job opportunities.

## Preparation

### Study Materials

I prepared for the PCPP1 exam using a combination of study materials, including:

* **Official Python Institute PCPP1 Certification Guide:** This comprehensive guide covered all the topics required for
  the exam. It provided in-depth explanations, examples, and practice questions.

1) [Advanced OOP](https://edube.org/study/pcpp1-1)
1) [Best Practices and Standardization](https://edube.org/study/pcpp1-2)
1) [GUI Programming](https://edube.org/study/pcpp1-2)
1) [Network Programming](https://edube.org/study/pcpp1-3)
1) [File Processing and Communicating with a Program's Environment](https://edube.org/study/pcpp1-4)

   Some exercises you can find [in](src/exercices).

* **Practice Exams**:
  I took multiple practice exams to get a feel for the exam format and to identify areas where I needed more practice.
  Some of the files in this repository are owned by [*OpenEDG*](dumps/1.%20POO.md).

Dumps that I recommend, these exams consist of 6 parts with 70 questions
each.: [Udemy - Paweł Krakowiak](https://www.udemy.com/course/pcpp1-certified-professional-in-python-programming/) it is
worth every penny. I can't share in this repo for privacy reasons.
If you are interested I can share some with you, write me to me [email](awainerc@gmail.com)

* **Python Documentation**:
  The official Python documentation was an invaluable resource. It helped me understand Python concepts in detail.
  Particularly
  about [TKinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html), [request](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  and https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html

* **Hands-on Coding**
  I spent a significant amount of time coding in Python to gain practical experience. Writing code and solving
  real-world problems helped reinforce my understanding of Python.
  I recommended install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to simulate server to consume API and Sockets.

* **Study Schedule**
  I created a study schedule that spanned several weeks. This allowed me to cover all the topics thoroughly without
  feeling rushed.
  If you already have the predecessor to this exam the PCAP and it has not been a long time since you studied it, it
  will be much easier to organize your schedule, I studied 1 module every two weeks because I took the PCAP two years
  ago.

## The Exam

### Format

The PCPP1 exam consists of a series of multiple-choice questions and coding exercises (45 in total). The questions cover
various Python topics, including POO(Study all), Tkinter, API(requests), Socket and a little about network(TCP|UDP). The
coding exercises require candidates to write Python code to solve specific problems.

### Time Management

Managing time during the exam is crucial. I allocated a specific amount of time for each section, To be honest you have
plenty of time, make sure you give it two or three checks until you are sure.

### Exam Environment

I took the PCPP1 exam remotely, which required a stable internet connection and a quiet environment. One thing to take
into account here is that the VUE platform through which the exam is given, is disgusting, personally I do not recommend
it to anyone but it's the only way at the moment and many companies use it, their graphics are old and unpleasant.

### Tips

Read each question carefully and ensure you understand the requirements before attempting to answer.

* For coding exercises, Don't be nervous, you are not going to write code, but you will need to concentrate to analyze,
  pay attention to each sign, space or character. The exercises are not difficult but they are to be careful in the
  details.

* Double-check your answers before submitting. It's easy to make simple mistakes, so review your work.

### My Experience

The PCPP1 exam was challenging but rewarding. It tested my knowledge of Python thoroughly. However, I would have to say
that this exam was a bit complex, there are some very tricky questions and besides technical knowledge you need
experience with the language or tools.

Don't be discouraged, life is a challenge.

### Conclusion

For this exam you need dedication, my recommendation is if you are starting in the Python world and you want to achieve this, first take the PCEP, second the PCAP and then don't let more time pass by, study this one,
It is possible to get this one without having the previous certifications, but you need a lot of experience with the concepts of programming, networking, GUI, file management in Python.

Passing the PCPP1 exam was a significant milestone in my journey to becoming a certified Python programmer. It validated
my Python skills and provided me with a valuable certification recognized in the industry.

I encourage anyone looking to enhance their Python programming skills to consider pursuing the PCPP1 certification. With
the right preparation and determination, it's an achievable goal that can open doors to exciting career opportunities in
Python development.
